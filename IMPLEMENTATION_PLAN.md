## Implementation Guidelines

### Testing Requirements
1. Unit Tests
   - Each component must have >80% coverage
   - All edge cases must be covered
   - Mock external dependencies

2. Integration Tests
   - Test component interactions
   - Verify system workflows
   - Test external integrations

3. BDD Tests
   - Cover all scenarios in feature files
   - Maintain step definitions
   - Regular test execution

### Quality Gates
1. Code Quality
   - SonarQube analysis
   - Code review approval
   - Documentation complete
   - Tests passing

2. Security
   - Security scan passed
   - Encryption verified
   - Access control tested
   - Audit logging confirmed

3. Performance
   - Load testing passed
   - Response times within SLA
   - Resource usage optimized
   - Scalability verified

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. Integration Complexity
   - Start with mock interfaces
   - Incremental integration
   - Regular integration testing

2. Performance Issues
