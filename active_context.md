# Electricity Utility System - Active Context

## Current Phase
Phase 2 - Specification Phase

## Project Status
- Phase 1 (Analysis) completed
- Phase 2 (Specification) in progress
- All required documentation created
- Feature specifications defined

## Active Components
1. Feature Files
   - 9 core features defined
   - All scenarios documented
   - BDD specifications complete

2. Contract Interfaces
   - Domain contracts defined
   - Step interfaces created
   - Test structure established

## Current Focus
1. Phase 2 Completion
   - All scenarios written ✓
   - All contracts defined ✓
   - Domain model contracts complete ✓
   - Documentation updated ✓
   - Awaiting USER approval

2. Phase 3 Preparation
   - Build configuration planning
   - Dependencies identification
   - Test infrastructure setup
   - Implementation sequence planning

## Pending Activities
1. Phase 2 Completion
   - Obtain USER approval for phase completion
   - Verify all documentation is up to date
   - Ensure all contracts are properly defined

2. Phase 3 Preparation
   - Define build configuration
   - List required dependencies
   - Plan test infrastructure
   - Create implementation sequence

## Known Constraints
1. Development Process
   - Must follow three-phase development approach ✓
   - Test-first development required ✓
   - Strict phase protection rules apply ✓
   - USER approval needed for phase transition

2. Technical Requirements
   - Contract-first development ✓
   - BDD test scenarios ✓
   - Domain-driven design ✓
   - Security and scalability focus ✓

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 2 Review
   - Verify all feature files
   - Review all contracts
   - Check documentation completeness
   - Request USER approval

2. Prepare Phase 3 Setup
   - Plan build configuration
   - Define dependency management
   - Design test infrastructure
   - Create implementation roadmap

## Current Risks
1. Process Risks
   - Ensuring all specifications are complete
   - Maintaining contract consistency
   - Preparing for implementation phase
   - Managing phase transition

2. Technical Risks
   - Contract design impacts implementation
   - Test infrastructure complexity
   - Integration points coordination
   - Performance requirements satisfaction
