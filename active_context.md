# Electricity Utility System - Active Context

## Current Phase
Phase 1 - Analysis Phase

## Project Status
- Initial project setup in progress
- Creating required context documentation
- Establishing project structure

## Active Components
None - Project initialization phase

## Current Focus
1. Documentation Setup
   - Creating required context files
   - Establishing project documentation structure
   - Defining initial requirements and boundaries

2. Project Structure
   - Basic directory structure created
   - Following prescribed project organization
   - Preparing for development phases

## Pending Activities
1. Documentation
   - Complete system architecture documentation
   - Define technical context
   - Create test scenarios
   - Document technical assumptions

2. Phase 1 Completion
   - Review all context files
   - Validate project structure
   - Prepare for Phase 2 transition

## Known Constraints
1. Development Process
   - Must follow three-phase development approach
   - Test-first development required
   - Strict phase protection rules apply

2. Technical Requirements
   - Modular architecture needed
   - Focus on maintainability
   - Security by design
   - Scalability requirements

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining context files
2. Review and validate Phase 1 deliverables
3. Prepare for Phase 2 transition
4. Document technical decisions and assumptions

## Current Risks
1. Process Risks
   - Ensuring complete documentation before phase transition
   - Maintaining strict phase separation
   - Following test-first development principles

2. Technical Risks
   - Architecture decisions impact on future phases
   - Technology stack selection
   - Integration complexity management
