# Electricity Utility System - System Architecture

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular, layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns and emphasis on maintainability, scalability, and security.

## Core Architecture Principles
1. Modularity
   - Independent functional modules
   - Loose coupling between components
   - High cohesion within modules
   - Clear interface definitions

2. Layered Architecture
   - Presentation Layer
     * User interface components
     * API endpoints
     * Client communication
   - Business Layer
     * Business logic
     * Service orchestration
     * Domain models
   - Data Layer
     * Data access
     * Storage management
     * Cache handling

3. Cross-Cutting Concerns
   - Security
   - Logging
   - Monitoring
   - Error handling
   - Configuration management
