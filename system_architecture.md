# System Architecture

## Architecture Overview
The Electricity Utility System follows a modular, domain-driven design approach with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Architectural Patterns
1. Domain-Driven Design
   - Clearly defined domain models
   - Bounded contexts for different utility operations
   - Rich domain model with business logic encapsulation

2. Contract-First Development
   - Interface-driven development
   - Clear contract definitions
   - Strict separation between contracts and implementations

3. Layered Architecture
   - Presentation Layer (UI/API)
   - Application Layer (Use Cases)
   - Domain Layer (Business Logic)
   - Infrastructure Layer (External Services)

## Domain Structure
1. Core Domains
   - Billing
   - Grid Monitoring
   - Consumption Monitoring
   - User Authentication
   - Role-Based Access
   - Data Security
   - Service Request
   - Usage Analytics
   - Online Payment

2. Domain Relationships
   - Clear boundaries between domains
   - Defined integration points
   - Explicit dependencies

## Testing Architecture
1. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
   - Gherkin feature files
   - Step definitions
   - Domain-specific test implementations

2. Test Structure
   - Feature specifications
   - Contract definitions
   - Step interfaces
   - Implementation tests

## Security Architecture
1. Security by Design
   - Role-based access control
   - Data security measures
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Secure communication

## Integration Architecture
1. Service Integration
   - Clear interface contracts
   - Dependency injection
   - Modular component design

## Quality Attributes
1. Maintainability
   - Modular design
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Interface-based contracts

2. Scalability
   - Independent domain scaling
   - Modular component design
   - Loose coupling

3. Testability
   - Contract-first approach
   - BDD test structure
   - Clear test boundaries

## Technical Stack
1. Development
   - Kotlin programming language
   - Test-driven development
   - BDD framework

2. Testing
   - Gherkin for specifications
   - Domain-specific test implementations
   - Automated test infrastructure

## Future Considerations
1. Extensibility
   - Plugin architecture support
   - New domain integration
   - Feature expansion capability

2. Evolution
   - Version management
   - Backward compatibility
   - Migration strategies
