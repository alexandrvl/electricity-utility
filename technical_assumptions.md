   - Assumption: APIs need to be stable and well-defined
   - Impact: More upfront design but better interface stability

3. Testing Strategy
   - BDD with Gherkin
   - Assumption: Business scenarios need to be clearly documented and testable
   - Impact: Requires maintaining feature files and step definitions

## Technical Constraints
1. Security Requirements
   - Role-based access control
   - Data encryption for sensitive information
